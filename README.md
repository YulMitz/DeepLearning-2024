# Utilizing Lossing Function Technique on DenseNet and Applying to Detect Lumbar Spine Degeneration
#### DeepLearning-2024 NCCU 113-Fall Final Project

## Dataset
[Kaggle Competition - RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2024-lumbar-spine-degenerative-classification)
> The goal of this competition is to create models that can be used to aid in the detection and classification of degenerative spine conditions using lumbar spine MR images. Competitors will develop models that simulate a radiologist's performance in diagnosing spine conditions.
* Medical images typically consist of normal cases, causing class imbalance
* In order to address imbalance problem, I've tried to experiment a loss function design from a reference paper
* Combining referenced loss function design and DenseNet structure may improve medical images classification task
